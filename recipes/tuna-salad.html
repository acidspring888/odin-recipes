<h1>Tuna Salad</h1>

<img src="images/tuna-salad.jpg" alt="Tuna Salad">

<p>Tuna Salad is one of my favorties, ever since I was a kid. It is cheap, easy, and, most importantly, delicious.</p>

<p>Since it only requires a few basic ingredients, anyone can make it. But it is also very easy to add a little personal taste to it. I personally like really spicy foods and usually add peppers and spices to my tuna salad. That is what will be in this recipe.</p>


<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
 <li>2 cans of chunk white tuna</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons mayo</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons sweet pickle relish</li>
 <li>1 jalepeno pepper</li> 
 <li>salt</li>
 <li>pepper</li>
 <li>cajun seasoning</li>
 <li>garlic powder</li>
 <li>onion powder</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>1. Open tuna cans and drain the water.</li>
  <li>2. Add tuna, mayo, and relish in medium sized mixing bowl</li>
  <li>3. Sit bowl in fridge to chill while you cut the jalepeno.</li>
  <li>4. Remove bowl, add in jalepeno and season to preference.</li>
  <li>5. Enjoy with crackers or toast some bread and make a sandwhich.</li>
</ol>
