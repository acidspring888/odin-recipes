<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Chili has always been my favortie food, although it is not always good. I consider myself a chili connoisseur, if somewhere has chili, I have probably tried it. With that being said, really good chili is few and far between.</p>

<p>Since I am from the south, chili has always been around. Chili cook-offs, everyone has "World Famous Chili", and you haven't had real chili "'till you tried ma's". Simply following this recipe will not guarantee a great chili because it takes more than just reading and following directions. But with time and effort you can have your own "World Famous Chili"!</p>

 <li>3 cups beef broth</li>

 <li>2 cans of kidney beans (light or dark) </li>
 <li>2 cans of tomato sauce</li>
 <li>1 tub of Bloomer's chili base</li>
 <li>Preferred seasonings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Cut tomato, onion, and jalepeno.</li>
